There are several challenges. Each challenge yields a prize which is suggestive
towards "sky cube".  The sky cube is where the physical part of the present is.

You start out in a very weird mansion and explore the rooms. Each of the rooms
contains a separate challenge.

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Challenge:
============================================
    - Finds a chest with "Ultimate T/F" inscribed on it
    -  Thinks its ultimate frisbee?
    - "You can faintly make out the word 'Ultimate', and some scratches afterwards"
    - turns out she opens it and its a game of ultimate tic tac toe
    - beat it to get the "prize"
    - the prize is something that hints towards "sky cube"

"pair of eyes" - pair of "is" - negative one

Goat Challenge:
=========================================
    - Task: Find rentagoat.com address and phone number closest to LA.
    - Room contains:
        table
        some random crap
        several postcards that have pictures of goats on them
        five broken lawnmowers
        a bloodstained napkin with rentagoat.com on it and "india street"
        a cell phone
        an entrance to a garden
            which is so overgrown you can't get in

    - Solution: examine items. realize you need goats.
                find goat nearest LA.
                find phone number.
                'call' the phone number.
                goats show up within seconds, chew through the garden.
                    (provide some funny stats about goats)

    - Notes: once you pick up the phone, you get a new ability, "call".

Random Crap Ideas:
===============================================
- Random stats about goats eating 8 pounds per day, being in the military, etc.
  Postcards?

- Congrats. You got the answer? Would you like a medal? You would? Well too
  bad. You're not getting one. 

- Find a large mug or stick or something and gain the power to "bash". If you
  try to "bash", the command raises an error about zsh being better. It kindly
  redirects you to zsh and then the prompt becomes random colors.
