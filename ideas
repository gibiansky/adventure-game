There are several challenges. Each challenge yields a prize which is suggestive
towards "sky cube".  The sky cube is where the physical part of the present is.

You start out in a very weird mansion and explore the rooms. Each of the rooms
contains a separate challenge. Rooms have bizarre and amusing descriptions.

Challenges are linear.
Order:
    Starter room - sky, hawk
    Goat Challenge - cubes
    Ultimate Challenge - sky
    Vim Challenge - cube
    Last Challenge

Starter room:
=============
    You are on in a strange room. 
    [room description]
    Are you okay with that?
        - invalid: I have no idea what you mean. Just say 'yes' or 'no'. Who do you think I am, Eliza?
        - yes: Good! [if immediately yes: You didn't really have a choice anyway.]
                     [else: I'm glad you're so agreeable.]
        - no: You should really be more okay with it. Try again.
              OR
              Are you sure that's a good idea? It might lead to some serious cognitive dissonance issues later on. Try again.
              OR
              Maybe you should reconsider saying "no" again and just say "yes".
              OR
              I'm not letting you go anywhere until you say yes. So just say "yes".

    [if not immediate yes: Awesome. You're learning. Let's try the next one!]
    [if immediate yes: Since you've started agreeing with me, why not continue? Let's try the next one.]

    As of now, you've been appointed to the position of Head Scapegoat.
    Do you accept this position?
        - invalid: Sorry, I would take a non-yes/no answer, but it's your birthday. Special case here.
        - yes: Sweet. Silver one, Tasha zero.
        - no: I'm can't let you do that, Da-- Tasha.
              YOU. SHALL. NOT. PASS. Erm. Say no. Whatever. FLEE YOU FOOLS.
              right_answer = "yes"; me = &right_answer; // Pointing you in the right direction.

    You have gained the power to "observe". Try observing your environment by typing "observe" into the prompt.

    on "observe *":
        You notice that this room as well as this game is pretty terrible so far. But that's not all..

        You also notice that you've completed the first challenge.  Your prize
        is a hooloovoo.  Make sure to consult it later, as it may be quite
        important.

        The room you're in is a large circular room. It's church-sized. Really damn big.
        There's several hundred doors along the edge of the room. You could probably try them all.

        > You have gained the power to "consult".
    on "consult hooloovoo":
        Hello, I am a Hooloovoo. The only information known about me is what
        color I am, so I guess that's all you can really hope to get out of me.
        I'm almost as bad as the pikka bird. Anyway, you're on your own. 

        By the way, you really should pick-a-bird. I'll give you one of your choice.
        The right one will lead you onwards.

        Also, my consultant fee is a few kilocents per millibit. I'll send you
        an invoice in a bit. (That one will cost you, too.)
              
        > You have gained the power to "become-totally-broke".          
        > You have gained the power to "guess-color".
        > You have gained the power to "choose-bird".

    on "guess-color blue":
        Good job. I'm proud of you. Are you proud of yourself? Good. Me too.

        You now possess the concept of blue.

    on "choose-bird hawk":
        Eh, sure, why not. That's an okay answer. Go ahead, take one.

        You now possess a hawk. It somehow points towards one of the doors, suggesting you open that door.
        > You gain the power to "open-door".
        
    on "choose-bird <not hawk>:"
      That's a good bird, I guess. I'm not sure it's the one you want, though.
      I'd go for this one.
        [outline of a hawk]
      
      if first time: > You have gained the power of "request-hint".

    on "open-door:"
        You leave the room feeling incredibly self-satisfied. You've gotten
        past the stupid room, now maybe this will become a bit less silly?

        Ahahahahah. That was a good joke.

        Be observant. 
    

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Challenge:
============================================
    - Finds a chest with "Ultimate T/F" inscribed on it
    -  Thinks its ultimate frisbee?
    - "You can faintly make out the word 'Ultimate', and some scratches afterwards"
    - turns out she opens it and its a game of ultimate tic tac toe
    - beat it to get the "prize"
    - the prize is something that hints towards sky:
        A plaque labeled "What's up?"
        examining the plaque:
            You notice the plaque has something drawn on it. It looks like you sitting outside, starting awkwardly upwards.
            You're in the middle of Linde field. So, actually, what's up?

Goat Challenge:
=========================================
    - Task: Find rentagoat.com address and phone number closest to LA.
    - Room contains:
        table
        some random crap
        several postcards that have pictures of goats on them
        five broken lawnmowers
        a bloodstained napkin with rentagoat.com on it and "india street"
        a cell phone
        an entrance to a garden
            which is so overgrown you can't get in

    - Solution: examine items. realize you need goats.
                find goat nearest LA.
                find phone number.
                'call' the phone number.
                goats show up within seconds, chew through the garden.
                    (provide some funny stats about goats)

    - Notes: once you pick up the phone, you get a new ability, "call".
    - Prize: something that hints at sky or cube
        You find something that looks like an incredibly bizarre paper towel dispenser.
        It seems to have some text and directions on it.

        Examining it:
            The bizarre paper towel dispenser is actually an infinite list.
            It's labelled "take N", followed by a bizarre string of letters and numbers: "$map(^3)[1..]" 
            It also has a picture of a programmer looking thoroughly confused.
            You examine it some more. Nothing seems to change.
            You gain the power to "harass". Try harassing this thing.
            You feel an overwhelming urge to figure out what type of object thing thing dispenses, since it's clearly not paper towels.

            harass (paper towel dispenser|dispenser|infinite list|list|thing|this thing):
                You try to harass the infinite list. Nothing changes. It is immutable. This is probably why the programmer is confused. Why is everything immutable?!


Vim Challenge:
==============
    - Task: Complete several vimgolf holes.
    - On start:
        - Give her vim functions to put in ~/.vimrc
        - These functions are VimGolfStart() and VimGolfEnd()
    - Each hole reveals next one
    - Need good enough score
        - if score is not good enough, examines keystrokes and gives suggestions
            - suggestions:  avoid "hjkl"
                            use searches / and ? for movement
                            record and playback with q and @
                            use search and replace
                            use n and N for repeating searches
                            install vim-repeat via Bundle
    - Each hole also reveals a few lines of vimscript code 
        - these lines of code are not necessary consecutive!
        - they can consist of bizarre mappings
        - last hole reveals a single line of code which draws a cube in ASCII 
    - Flavortext, upon completing last hole:
        Gained power: "hallucinate"
        hallucinate: You can hallucinate some objects into being, especially if you've seen them drawn in ASCII before.
        "hallucinate cube" -- gives you a cube in inventory

Final Challenge:
================
    - Task: guess the phrase "sky cube"

    The corridor leads to yet another room. This room is almost completely barren. 

    The two things in it are a large sign and a very futuristic-looking computer.

    on "observe sign":
        The sign says "Welcome to the Quantum Teleportation Device."

        There's also a subscript, which reads, "Be aware that this device does not, in any way, utilize quantum physics for the purpose of teleportation.
        It is quantum solely because the teleportation is quantized - we promise you that you will not be fractionally telported.
        In the off chance that this is what happens, we promise to reimburse you for all damages, provided that you are still around to claim them.

        The're also a really small warning which in bright red reads, "Warning: This device is magic."

    on "observe computer":
        The computer is attached to a keyboard. On screen you see a game of hangman, with eight spaces in the word or phrase.

        It's labeled, "Where would you like to teleport?"

        > You gained the power to "type".

    on "type sky cube":
        The computer beeps loudly. Beep beep. Bloop bloop.

        You are being teleported to the Sky Cube.

        (Go there. You have completed this game. Congratulations.)

    on "type <not 'sky cube'>":
        The computer beeps loudly. Beep beep. Bloop bloop. 
        
        The world begins to fade around you, slowly turning to black, and -- BZZZZT.

        BEEEEEP. 

        You are once more back the teleporter room. Looks like that wasn't a valid location.

        The hangman looks slightly more unhappy than he was when you came in.
        But then again, he's condemned to die anyways, so what's there to be
        happy about? His life must really suck.

        Luckily, you're doesn't. Unlike him, you get to try again.

Random Crap Ideas:
===============================================
- Random stats about goats eating 8 pounds per day, being in the military, etc.
  Postcards?

- Congrats. You got the answer? Would you like a medal? You would? Well too
  bad. You're not getting one. 

- Find a large mug or stick or something and gain the power to "bash". If you
  try to "bash", the command raises an error about zsh being better. It kindly
  redirects you to zsh and then the prompt becomes random colors.

- It's only mooing when you do it.
