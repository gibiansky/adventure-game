    You are in a strange room. 

    You'd really like to look around and find out what this room is like, but
    for some reason you can't. In fact, you seem to be unable to do anything
    except concentrate on the voice in your head, which is letting you know
    that you're in a strange room, and that you'd like to look around but
    can't.

    Are you okay with that?

    [gain: yes]

    You have learned to say '_'.
    To use an ability, just type it into the prompt. Some abilities take arguments, but these don't.

    [gain: no]
    You have also learned to say '_'.

    {
    Good! You didn't really have a choice anyway.

    You're learning.
    }
    {
    Good! I'm glad you're so agreeable today.

    Since you've started agreeing with me, why not continue?
    }

    Let's try the next one.
    [move-to: init-2]

<power: no>
    [choose-by-count: no]
    {
    You should really be more okay with it. Try again.
    }
    {
    Are you sure that's a good idea? It might lead to some serious cognitive dissonance issues later on. Try another answer.
    }
    {
    Maybe you should reconsider saying 'no' again and just say 'yes'.
    }
    {
    I'm not letting you go anywhere until you say yes. So just say 'yes'.
    }
